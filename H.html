        Heterotrophic Nutrition
    </title>
    <h1>Heterotrophic Nutrition</h1>
    <h1></h1>
    -In this mode of nutrition organisms can't prepare their own food.They instead obtain from other organism
    <h2>
        Types :-
    </h2>
    <h3>i) Holozoic Nutrition </h3>
    Complex food molecules are taken it and then broken down into simpler and soluble molecules in this type of nutrition.Eg.Amoeba,Human beings,herbivores,carnivores & omnivores poses this mode of nutrition.
    <h3>ii) Saprotrophic Nutrition</h3>
    - In this organisms usually feed upon dead and decay organic matter preaking down complex material outside body and observe it.Eg. Fungi , Yeast etc.
    <h3>ii) Parasitic Nutrition</h3> 
    -In this organism live either on or inside the body of oragnism (host) to obtain nutrition without killing them.Eg.Cuscuta
    <h2># Nutrition In Amoeba</h2>
    Amoeba is an unicellular organism that does not possess specialised organfor
the process of nutrition. Mode of nutrition is holozoic & takes place with
the help of pseudopodia .
<h3>Process :-</h3>
<h3>i) Ingestion-</h3>
Psuedopodia engulfs the food comes in contact with its cell surface and from food vacuole.This process is called Ingestion.
<h3>ii) Digestion-</h3>
It is intracellular (takes place inside cell)in amoeba .Insisde the foof vaculole , complex food is broken down into small soluble molecule.
<h3>iii) Absorption-</h3>
Small soluble molecules are then readily observe by cytoplasm . This process is called Absorption.\
<h3>iv) Assimilation -</h3>
The absorped food is further assimilated by amoeba to usae energy for growth.
<h3>v) Egestion-</h3>
The undigested food material is removed by cell membrane which reptures suddenly at any place and eliminated out the undigested food which is known as Egestion.

<h2># Nutrition in Human Being</h2>
Digestion is a catabolic process , in which complex and large components of
food are broken down into simpler and smaller forms with help of
enzymes .

These simpler parts are taken by different parts of body and

absorbed . Entire system is known as digestive system.
<h3>Mechanism Of Digestion Of Food </h3>
<h3>1) Ingestion </h3>
- It means taking in food into mouth or buccal cavity . As the food
enters the mouth ft is moistened by saliva & moved around in mouth in
order to make chewing and swallowing easy by tongue . food is converted to
small particles by teeth .
<h3>2) Digestion </h3>
 -

As food is complex in nature ,

so itis converted into its simpler form
by the action of biological catalyst called enzymes. This process of breaking down of large organic molecules (like carbohydrates) to small molecules (like simple Sugar)
is called Digestion.
<h3>3) Absorbtion </h3>
-It is the process by which digested food passes from alimentary carat into the blood . All the digested food i. e. taken up by walls of intestine.
The inner surface of small intestine has numerous villi and lac teals which increase
the surface area of intestine and helps in absorption of digested food .
<h3> 4) Assimilation</h3>
- 4) Assimilation -

It is the process of distribution of digested food products to
various cells of the body for their utilisation in various metabolic
processes . The villi in small Intestine are richly supplied with blood
vessels which take the absorbed food to each and every cell of body to building new cells  or repair older ones.
<h3>5) Egestion</h3>
- The process of elimination of undigested food formed in the

color of the large intestine through anus is called egestion .

<h2>Peristalic Movement</h2>
- Contaraction and expansion of muscles of oesophagus to push the food forward.

<h2># Tooth Decay</h2>
The tooth decay in mouth occurs due to formation of a plaque . It occurs
when bacterial cells act upon the food particles , containing sugars and produce acids that soften the enamel .

Brushing of teeth after eating is one treatment .
